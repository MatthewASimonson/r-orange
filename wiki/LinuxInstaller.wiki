#labels Featured

= Prerequisites =

You should have access to the R repositories for installing r-base.  This information can be obtained from http://cran.r-project.org/

You must also download and configure PyQWT.  This can be done by obtaining the .tar.gz file from http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyqwt/files/

Extract this file, move to the file directory and run the following substituting your python directory where appropriate (make sure that you have python2.6 in your /usr/lib/ file).  Also you may have downloaded a different version of qwt which should also be changed in the commands below.
{{{
cd configure
python configure.py -Q ../qwt-5.1 --module-install-path=/usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/PyQt4/Qwt5
make
sudo make install
}}}

= Installation =
By installing Red-R you agree to all licences and copywrite notifications within the copywrite file in the download.  

You may run from the command line:
{{{
sudo dpkg -i Red-R_<version>_all.deb
}}}

Once all dependencies are resolved you should be able to run:
{{{
python /usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/RedR/OrangeCanvas/orngCanvas.pyw
}}}

To have a desktop icon you should make an icon using your file browser running the above command.
