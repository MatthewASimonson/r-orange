#summary Definition of the RvarClasses for use in ROrange Widgets

= Class Structure =

Orange requires that variables be passed between widgets in the form of ornage.Variable objects.  Widgets may connect to any other widget when the output is of the same class or a subclass of the input of downstreatm widgets.  RvarClasses defines a class structure all subclasses of the orange.Variable class for use in R widgets.  The 'master' class is the RVariable class which can recieve input from any member of RvarClasses.  Subclasses of this are the RDataFrame, RVector, and RList classes.  Additional classes can be constructed for more specific classes of R variables.

import RvarClasses

class MyRvarClass(RvarClasses.RVariable):
    pass

By defining this and importing into both the output and input widgets the two will be able to send and recieve signals from MyRvarClass.  One should note that any widget that can accept the parent class of RvarClasses.RVariable will also be able to connect to this widget.  To prevent this one can make a call directly to the orange.Variable class and make their class a child of orange.Variable.
