= Milestone 1 =
Milestone 1 is a proof-of-concept with a functional framework. The release has widgets for basic table manipulation including reading, subsetting, merging, and plotting. Furthermore  this release showcases a functional pipeline for Affymetrix microarray chip analysis using the Bioconductor R package. This release includes widgets with the ability to read in Cel files, normalize, select present genes, perform differential expression and visualize differentially expressed genes in a pathway viewer.
 * User feedback

=Milestone 2 =
Milestone 2 will build upon the framework of Milestone 1. The two key goals of this milestone:
 * Rewrite the canvas, signalling, GUI framework to allow easy saving and restoring of pipeline state. 
  * Including all data and GUI 
 * Dramatically increase the number of R libraries available
  * Improve widgetMaker: a sophisticated tool for parsing R functions and creating Red widgets without any python expertise. 
 * Design a widget manager for installer, updating and searching library of widgets. 
 * How to discover new widgets
 * Develop interactive graphics in QT
 * Load pipelines into pipelines
 * Condense pipelines into widgets 
 * Pathway tracer 'replay' pathway analysis
 * Ghost widgets to show potential pipelines that may be of interest

=Milestone 3=
Can we really think that far ahead?! We can at least dream...

 * Cloud computing
 * WebRed
