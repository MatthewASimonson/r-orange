#summary Introduction to the !ReadFiles widget.

= Introduction =

Bringing data into a program is an essential part of data manipulation.  The !ReadFiles widget in RedR is perhaps the most used method of bringing data into the RedR schema.  This widget reads text files with either tab, space, or comma delimitation and parses it into a data table.  This data can then be passed onto other widgets.

The !ReadFiles GUI is divided into four sections; Data File at the top allows for the selection of a file to be read into the schema, File Options specifies how the file is to be read, Info provides a readout of the success of reading the file as well as what kind of data RedR things the columns of the file are, the final section is the output of scanning the file.
