#summary Description of the ReadCELFiles Widget

= Introduction =

High density microarray technology is becoming commonplace in biomedical research.  Analysis of these arrays in highly important for many biological investigations.  Here we show how to use the ReadCELFiles Widget.  This widget reads collections of CEL files, the file type generated by [http://www.affymetrix.com/index.affx Affymetrix(R)], using [http://www.bioconductor.org/ Bioconductor] functions in the [http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/affy.html affy] package.

The widget can be opened by finding the widget icon in the Bioconductor tab of the widget tree view or by typing Read CEL Files into the widget search line edit at the top of the widget tree view.  Once the widget is in the canvas open the widget by double-clicking and select the number of arrays that you would like to read in.  After this open the file browser by clicking the '...' button.  Once in the file browser input the path of your file or browse to it by clicking the 'Browse' button.  Once you have selected the folder that contains your data click 'OK'.  Data processing begins immediately.  Once your data is processed you may send either the expression matrix, similar to a data.frame, to widgets that may accept this type of input or the Eset object to other downstream analysis widgets.
